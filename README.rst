For more information about the Pelican settings you can visit http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/settings.html#themes
i found them useful during the whole design process of the blog

Pelican comes with its own default theme, so when you want  download this theme .

First, choose a location to hold your theme. For this example, we'll use the directory ~/themes, but yours could be different. Clone the pelican-themes repository to that location on your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/fjavieralba/flasky ~/themes
Now you should have your pelican-themes repository stored at ~/themes/.

To use one of the themes, edit your Pelican settings file to include this line:

THEME = "~/themes/flasky"
So, for instance, to use the mnmlst theme, you would edit your settings file to include:

THEME = "~/themes/mnmlst"
Save the changes to your settings file and then regenerate your site by using the Makefile you should already have set up using pelican-quickstart:

make html
Themes can also be specified directly via the -t ~/themes/flask parameter to the pelican command. If you want to edit your theme, make sure that any edits you make are made to the copy stored in ~/themes/flask. Any changes made to files stored in your site's output directory will be deleted the next time you generate your site.
